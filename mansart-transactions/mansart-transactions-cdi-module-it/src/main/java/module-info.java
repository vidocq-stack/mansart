/**
 * Module-path proof vehicle for Mansart Transactions CDI: verifies that a {@code @Transactional}
 * bean is intercepted on the module path with NO {@code opens} directive and NO runtime-generated
 * subclass.
 *
 * <p>The Vauban APT generates {@code TxService$$Intercepted} (build time) plus the in-module
 * {@code _VaubanComponents} provider declared below. The Vauban container instantiates the bean,
 * field-injects it and runs the interception chain through that provider, so this module opens
 * nothing to {@code io.vidocq.vauban.core}. It depends on {@code vauban-core} for real (it boots a
 * container, and the generated subclass references {@code io.vidocq.vauban.core.interceptor.*}).</p>
