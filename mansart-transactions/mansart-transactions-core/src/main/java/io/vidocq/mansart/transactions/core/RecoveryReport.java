/**
 * Outcome of a {@link MansartTransactionManager#recover(javax.transaction.xa.XAResource[])} run :
 * which Xids were auto-resolved (commit / rollback against the driver) and which remain in doubt
 * because no provided {@link javax.transaction.xa.XAResource} knew about them.
 *
 * <p>{@code committed} = the Mansart journal said COMMITTING and the driver still had the branch ;
 * we replayed the commit. {@code rolledBack} = the journal said only PREPARED ; we rolled back
 * because no durable commit decision exists. {@code stillInDoubt} = the journal mentioned a branch
 * that none of the supplied drivers know about → operator must investigate (driver was offline,
 * has its own forget rules, is on another machine, etc.).
