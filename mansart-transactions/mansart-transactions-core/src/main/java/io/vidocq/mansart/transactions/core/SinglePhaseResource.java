/**
 * Marker for an enlisted resource that cannot really prepare — its {@code prepare} vote is a
 * formality ({@code XA_OK} without flushing) and its {@code commit} is the actual, irreversible
 * local commit. The JDBC local-transaction wrapper ({@code ConnectionXAResource} in
 * {@code mansart-transactions-jdbc}) is the canonical implementation.
 *
 * <p>{@link MansartTransaction} applies the last-resource-commit optimisation (LRCO) to these
 * resources in its two-phase path: after every resource has voted, single-phase resources are
 * committed <b>first</b> — their local commit is the de-facto decision point — and if one of
 * them fails, the real XA resources (still merely prepared) are rolled back cleanly instead of
 * being committed against a half-applied outcome. One single-phase resource per transaction is
 * therefore safe; with two or more, the window between their commits remains best-effort.
