/**
 * Single virtual-thread loop that periodically scans the idle deque for connections past their
 * {@link PoolConfig#idleTimeout()} or {@link PoolConfig#maxLifetime()}, closes them, and lets the
 * pool create fresh ones on demand.
 *
 * <p>Runs on a virtual thread because the loop spends almost all its time parked. Sweep period is
 * {@code idleTimeout / 4} so an expired connection is reclaimed within roughly its own idle window
 * (good enough — we are not a watchdog).
 *
 * <p>Failures inside {@link ConnectionPool#sweep} are logged at WARNING and never propagate; a
 * crashed housekeeper would leak idle connections silently which is far worse than a swallowed log.
