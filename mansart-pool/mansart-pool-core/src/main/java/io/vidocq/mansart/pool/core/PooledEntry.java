 * The pool-internal handle on a driver {@link Connection}: tracks its lifetime, gets parked in the
 * idle deque, and is wrapped in a fresh {@link PooledConnection} on every borrow.
 *
 * <p>Why a separate type? A wrapper recycled across borrows would have to mutate its own
 * "user has called close()" flag — and a stale {@code Connection} reference held by the previous
 * borrower would suddenly look "open" again after a re-borrow. A new {@link PooledConnection}
 * per borrow keeps the lifecycle rule simple: <i>close-then-reuse-the-same-handle</i> is always
 * a misuse, observable via {@code isClosed()}.
