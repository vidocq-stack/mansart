# STATUS-JKP

Counters only. A line here is written by a tool, never by an agent.

## TCK

```
tck:    jakarta.tck:persistence-tck-spec-tests:3.2.1
module: (not created yet — M0-T001)
result: PASS=? FAIL=? ERROR=? SKIP=?   (never run)

**Total: 249 cards, 6 done.**

## Done cards

One line per finished card, WITH the evidence that closed it: a build log,
a TCK counter, a command and its exit code. A card with no evidence line is
not done, whatever an agent reported.

**A row goes here ONLY when the card's own done-when command exited 0.**
An agent once wrote `M0-T001 ... Build fails with exit 1 (expected)` and
counted it done: the evidence contradicted the card in the same sentence.
If the done-when cannot pass yet, the card is not done — say what blocks it
in the Log, not here.

| Card | Date | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| M0-T001 | 2026-09-11 15:05 | verify-m0.sh: parent module registered in the root reactor |
| M0-T002 | 2026-09-11 15:05 | verify-m0.sh: runner compiles in its own directory |
| M0-T003 | 2026-09-11 15:05 | verify-m0.sh: TCK jar declared and resolving (jakarta.tck:persistence-tck-spec-tests:3.2.1) |
| M0-T004 | 2026-09-11 15:05 | verify-m0.sh: run script + Arquillian config present |
| M0-T005 | 2026-09-11 15:05 | verify-m0.sh: the TCK produced a counter, any counter |
| M0-T006 | 2026-09-11 15:05 | verify-m0.sh: the counter measures the implementation, not the harness |
