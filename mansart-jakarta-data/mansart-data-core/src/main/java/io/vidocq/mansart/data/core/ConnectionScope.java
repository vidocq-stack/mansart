/**
 * Propagates a {@link Connection} to the inner action via a {@link ScopedValue}, so that nested
 * runtime calls reuse the same connection (transaction context) without resorting to
 * {@code ThreadLocal}.
 *
 * <p>Two entry points:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #withConnection} — opens a connection in auto-commit mode for the action's lifetime.
 *       If a connection is already bound by an enclosing scope, it is reused. This is the path the
 *       generated repository implementations take for every CRUD / JDQL call.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #inTransaction} — opens a connection in manual-commit mode, binds it to the same
 *       {@link ScopedValue}, runs the body, and commits on success or rolls back on any thrown
 *       exception. Inside the body, every nested {@link #withConnection} hits the bound connection
 *       and therefore lands in the same transaction. Repository providers (mansart-pool,
 *       HikariCP, JNDI…) only need to expose a {@link DataSource} — the transaction orchestration
 *       lives entirely here.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>{@link #inTransaction} is virtual-thread-safe: {@link ScopedValue} propagates to child
 * {@link StructuredTaskScope} forks, but explicit thread-creation outside such a scope does NOT
 * inherit the bound connection — a deliberate choice that makes the transaction boundary explicit
 * and prevents accidental connection sharing across unrelated work.
