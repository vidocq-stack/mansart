/**
 * Links repository operations to an externally managed transaction (MANSART-007).

 * <p>{@link ConnectionScope#withConnection(TransactionBridge, DataSource, ConnectionScope.SqlAction)}
 * consults the bridge before opening its per-operation autocommit connection: when the caller
 * runs inside an active transaction, the bridge returns the connection enlisted in it for the
 * given datasource — every repository operation of that transaction then shares it, and the
 * transaction outcome (commit/rollback) governs the writes.
 *
 * <p>This SPI keeps {@code mansart-data-core} free of any transaction-API dependency: the JTA
 * implementation lives in {@code mansart-data-cdi} ({@code JtaTransactionBridge}) and is only
 * installed when a {@code TransactionManager} is present in the deployment.
