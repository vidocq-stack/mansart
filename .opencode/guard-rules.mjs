// mansart-guard rules — pure functions, unit-testable.
// NOT under .opencode/plugin/: OpenCode treats EVERY export of a plugin file as a
// plugin, calls it with {directory}, and dies on the first one returning null
// (`plugin config hook failed: null is not an object`). Rules live here, the
// plugin file exports exactly one thing.
//
// Every rule here exists because it was measured on this repo (Vibe V3 logs,
// 10 sessions / 1 701 steps), not because it sounded prudent:
//
//   - 262 Maven runs logged exit_code 0 while 38 had failed  -> raw maven denied
//   - 218 find calls, the same one 75 times in 3 spellings   -> 3rd search denied
//   - 476 read_file calls, 40% re-reading an unchanged file  -> re-read denied
//   - 28% of primary context was raw bash output             -> long cat denied
//
// Contract: the guard NEVER hard-fails a session. Any internal error lets the
// call through with a warning — the path denylist stays the hard guarantee.
// Refusal works by throwing: OpenCode surfaces the message to the model, which
// then corrects itself (verified 2026-09-09).
